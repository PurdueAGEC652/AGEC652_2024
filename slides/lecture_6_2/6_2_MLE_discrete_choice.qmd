- We will build an economic model to describe how people make discrete choices
- We will create synthetic data based on that model
- Then, based on this data, we will use MLE to estimate the parameters of a discrete demand system
- Finally, we will use the estimated parameters to perform a counterfactual exercise

- In the 1970s, California started building the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system
- It would cost \$1.6 B but the benefits were unclear: how many people would actually use it?
- One idea: a survey. Just ask people in the Bay area what transportation modes they use and whether they would switch

- But Daniel McFadden, at the time a Prof. of Economics at UC Berkeley, was concerned: 
  - *Can people predict how they'll use something that doesn't yet exist?*
- McFadden's idea: observe what people actually do and use theory to predict what they would do
- To McFadden, using survey data + economic theory would deliver better results than a survey alone

- Predictions:
  - Surveys: 15% of respondents said they'd use BART
  - McFadden's estimates: 6%  of respondents said they'd use BART


## Background: revealed vs. stated preferences

-  McFadden's idea turned out to be correct in this case: In fact, about 6% of the respondents actually used BART

. . .  

- This idea has been very influencial in economics, marketing, and other social sciences: study **revealed preferences** rather than **stated preferences**
  - I.e., trust more the data on what people do, not what they say they will do
- Estimation based on revealed preferences is at the core of demand estimation and consumer behaviour modeling used in academia, industry, policy, and courts

. . .

- But what is revealed preference, anyway?


# Revealed preference

## Revealed preference

In the context of empirical economics, *revealed preference* can be interpreted as an assumption:

> If there are two choices, A and B, and we observe a person choose A, then her utility from A is greater than her utility from B.

Let's create an example!


## Revealed preference example

**Setting**: we have data on a large number of consumers who made a choice between two products A and B at different prices

Each individual will have an *unobserved* characteristic $u$ (their utility). We will make two assumptions

> **Assumption 1: Additive separability, linearity on money.** The value an individual $i$ gets from purchasing product $k \in \{A,B\}$ is $V_{ki} = u_{ki} - p_k$. This is, the unobserved utility of consuming $k$ minus the price paid to consume it 

## Revealed preference example

> **Assumption 2: Revealed prefernce.** If an individual $i$ purchases product A, then $u_{A,i} - p_A > u_{B,i} - p_B \Rightarrow u_{A,i} - u_{B,i} > p_A - p_B$

. . .

- Utility is measured on an arbitrary scale, so we can normalize it by picking one choice to be the reference one
- Here, we will normalize to product B and write

$$
p = p_A - p_B
$$

and 

$$
u_i = u_{Ai} - u_{Bi}
$$


## Revealed preference example: data

Let's create some data to illustrate revealed preference

In this illustration, we assume the unobserved normalized utility is normally distributed $u \sim N(1,9)$, and that we have $N=1000$ i.i.d observations

```{julia}
using Random, Distributions
Random.seed!(652); # For reproducibility
N = 1000;
μ_u = 1;
σ_u = 3;
u_is = rand(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), N);
```


## Revealed preference example: data

Next, let's use this distribution to generate the observations of behavior for a (relative) price $p = 2$

We will define $y_i = 1$ if individual $i$ purchases option A, and $y_i = 0$ if $i$ purchases B

```{julia}
p = 2;
y_is = (u_is .- p .> 0);
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Can we use the observed behavior $y_i$ to uncover the unobserved term $u_i$?

. . .

Probably not, because $y_i$ as are binary but $u_i \in \mathbb{R}$ 

```{julia}
using Plots, LaTeXStrings
Plots.scatter(u_is, y_is, xlabel=L"$u_i$", ylabel=L"$y_i$", label="")
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

But what about aggregate behavior? Can it at least inform about the mean of the distribution?

```{julia}
println("We know that $(mean(y_is)*100)% of consumers have u > p")
```

How can we compare that to the population distribution $N(1, 9)$?

. . .

By using the CDF!

```{julia}
1 - cdf(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), p)
```

So the data allowed us to get an estimate of how many individuals have $u_i > 2$

What do we need to be able to say more about this distribution?


## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

If we want to say something about the CDF of $u$ at more points, we need to observe behavior at more prices!

Instead of having a single price, suppose we could confront each consumer with a range of prices and observe their purchasing behavior

We will organize that information in data matrix Z

```{julia}
p_grid = collect(-10:10)
# Rows are individuals i, columns are prices
Z = [(u - p > 0) for u in u_is, p in p_grid]
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Now, for each price level $p_j$, we can calculate the proportion of consumers that chose to purchase A ($y_i(p_j) = 1$)

$$
s(p_j) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} y_i(p_j)
$$


```{julia}
s_p = zeros(length(p_grid))
for j in 1:length(p_grid)
  s_p[j] = mean(Z[:,j]) # Calculate mean of column j
end
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Let's plot $s(p_j)$


```{julia}
plot(s_p, p_grid, xlabel=L"$s$", ylabel=L"$p$", label="Observed")
plot!(1 .- cdf.(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), p_grid), p_grid, linestyle=:dash, label="True distribution")
```

Look at the labels... What kind of curve is this?

. . .

Yep, we just estimated a demand function! (Note that $Q = s \times N$)

# Discrete choice models

## Latent variable model

- In the previous example, we can regard $u_i$ as a **latent** (or hidden) variable
  - We don't know its true value, but we observe a consequence of that value based on a cut-off point

. . .

- The classic binary discrete choice model can be framed as a latent variable model, with the latent variable

$$
y_i^* = X_i^\prime \beta + \nu_i
$$

where $X_i$ is a vector of observed characteristics, $\nu_i$ an unobserved term (assumed uncorrelated with $X_i$), and $\beta$ is a vector that maps characteristics to the value of the latent variable

. . .

- We do not observe $y_i^*$, but only the outcome $y_i$

$$
y_i = \begin{cases}
1\mbox{, if } $y_i^* \geq 0\\
0\mbox{, if } $y_i^* < 0
\end{cases}
$$


## Latent variable model

- Although we don't observe $y_i^*$ directly, we can reason about the probabilities of seeing specific values of $y_i$
- For instance

$$
\begin{align}
\Pr(y_i = 1 | X_i) & = \Pr(y_i^* > 0) \\
& = \Pr(X_i^\prime \beta + \nu_i > 0) \\
& = \Pr(\nu_i > -X_i^\prime \beta) \\
& = 1 - F(-X_i^\prime \beta) \\
\end{align}
$$

where $F$ is the CDF of the distribution of $\nu_i$

. . .

- If we knew $\beta$, we could determine the distribution of $\nu_i$
  - That's what we did in the previous exercise, where $\beta$ was 1

. . .

- But we rarely know the true $\beta$, so we need to estimate it


## Estimating the latent variable model

- The problem in estimating $\beta$ is that we cannot both $\beta$ and $F$ at the same time, so we need to make some restriction in one of them

. . .

- One common approach is to assume that $\nu_i$ is normally distributed following the standard normal, so $F$ is the $\Phi$, or the standard normal CDF

$$
\Pr(y_i = 1 | X_i) = 1 - \Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)
$$

- This is the starting point of the **binomial Probit** model!

. . .

- Note that $\beta$ is a nonlinear term in this equation, so we need a nonlinear estimator. MLE is a great candidate!


## Estimating Probit with MLE

- The first step is to assemble the likelihood function
- But let's start with a single observation. We know that^[The second step uses the symmetry of the Normal distribution.]

$$
\begin{align}
\Pr(y_i = 0 | X_i) & = \Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta) \\
\Pr(y_i = 1 | X_i) & = 1 - \Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta) = \Phi(X_i^\prime \beta)
\end{align}
$$

. . .

There's a clever way to combine these expressions depending on the value of $y_i$

$$
\Pr(y_i| X_i, \beta)  = \left[\Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{1-y_i} \left[\Phi(X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{y_i}
$$

- That is: if $y_i = 0$, the exponent of the fist term is $1$ and of second term is $0$, so we select the first one
  - If $y_i = 1$, the opposite happens


## Estimating Probit with MLE
$$
\Pr(y_i| X_i, \beta)  = \left[\Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{1-y_i} \left[\Phi(X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{y_i}
$$

With the i.i.d. assumption, it's easy to write the likelihood function as the product of these probabilities

$$
L(y, X | \beta) = \prod_{i=1}^N \left[\Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{1-y_i} \left[\Phi(X_i^\prime \beta)\right]^{y_i}
$$

. . .

Taking the logs to get the log-likelihood function, the MLE estimator is given by

$$
\hat\beta_{MLE} = \arg \max_\beta = \sum_{i=1}^N (1-y_i)\left[\Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)\right]  + y_i \left[1 - \Phi(-X_i^\prime \beta)\right]
$$


## Estimating Probit with MLE

- One thing seems to be missing, though. Where's $\sigma^2$?

. . .

- Turns out, we can't identify it!
  - This means that there is an infinite number of values of $\sigma^2$ that can be found to be consistent with the data

. . .

- Intuitively, the observed outcome ($y_i$) only gives us information about a location: where the latent variable crosses a threshold
  - So you could increase $\sigma^2$ and $\beta$ in the same proportion and end up with the same probabilities

## Estimating Probit with MLE

For example, suppose we had two candidates: $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$. The problem is that we can find $\beta_a$ and $\beta_b$ such that
$$
\Phi(\frac{X_i^\prime \beta_a}{\sigma_a}) = \Phi(\frac{X_i^\prime \beta_b}{\sigma_b})
$$

. . .

- So $\beta$ and $\sigma$ are not separately identifiable, only their ratio!
- The common practice is to assume $\sigma = 1$

## Binomial Logit

- Another common assumption for the distribution of the unobserved terms are distributed following a **logistic distribution**, which gives

$$
\Pr(y_i = 1 | X_i) = \Lambda(X_i^\prime \beta) = \frac{e^{X_i^\prime \beta}}{1 + e^{X_i^\prime \beta}}
$$

- This is the foundation of the **Binomial Logit** model


## TBA


- Logit
- Simulation and estimation
- Multinomial probit and logit
- Simulation and estimation
- Another common assumption for the distribution of the unobserved terms are distributed followin the [Type 1 Extreme Value** distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution), a.k.a. Gumbel or log-Weibull distributions
- This choice is made for analytical convenience: it implies that the difference between unobserved follows a **logistic distribution**
