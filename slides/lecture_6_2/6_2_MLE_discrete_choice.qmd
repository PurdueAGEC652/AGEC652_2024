## Agenda {background-color="gold"}

- This unit is a step-by-step exercise in structural modeling
- We will build an economic model to describe how people make discrete choices
- We will create synthetic data based on that model
- Then, based on this data, we will use MLE to estimate the parameters of a discrete demand system
- Finally, we will use the estimated parameters to perform a counterfactual exercise

- In the 1970s, California started building the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system
- It would cost \$1.6 B but the benefits were unclear: how many people would actually use it?
- One idea: a survey. Just ask people in the Bay area what transportation modes they use and whether they would switch

- But Daniel McFadden, at the time a Prof. of Economics at UC Berkeley, was concerned: 
  - *Can people predict how they'll use something that doesn't yet exist?*
- McFadden's idea: observe what people actually do and use theory to predict what they would do
- To McFadden, using survey data + economic theory would deliver better results than a survey alone

- Predictions:
  - Surveys: 15% of respondents said they'd use BART
  - McFadden's estimates: 6%  of respondents said they'd use BART


## Background: revealed vs. stated preferences

-  McFadden's idea turned out to be correct in this case: In fact, about 6% of the respondents actually used BART

. . .  

- This idea has been very influencial in economics, marketing, and other social sciences: study **revealed preferences** rather than **stated preferences**
  - I.e., trust more the data on what people do, not what they say they will do
- Estimation based on revealed preferences is at the core of demand estimation and consumer behaviour modeling used in academia, industry, policy, and courts

. . .

- But what is revealed preference, anyway?


# Revealed preference

## Revealed preference

In the context of empirical economics, *revealed preference* can be interpreted as an assumption:

> If there are two choices, A and B, and we observe a person choose A, then her utility from A is greater than her utility from B.

Let's create an example!


## Revealed preference example

**Setting**: we have data on a large number of consumers who made a choice between two products A and B at different prices

Each individual will have an *unobserved* characteristic $u$ (their utility). We will make two assumptions

> **Assumption 1: Additive separability, linearity on money.** The value an individual $i$ gets from purchasing product $k \in \{A,B\}$ is $V_{ki} = u_{ki} - p_k$. This is, the unobserved utility of consuming $k$ minus the price paid to consume it 

## Revealed preference example

> **Assumption 2: Revealed prefernce.** If an individual $i$ purchases product A, then $u_{A,i} - p_A > u_{B,i} - p_B \Rightarrow u_{A,i} - u_{B,i} > p_A - p_B$

. . .

- Utility is measured on an arbitrary scale, so we can normalize it by picking one choice to be the reference one
- Here, we will normalize to product B and write

$$
p = p_A - p_B
$$

and 

$$
u_i = u_{Ai} - u_{Bi}
$$


## Revealed preference example: data

Let's create some data to illustrate revealed preference

In this illustration, we assume the unobserved normalized utility is normally distributed $u \sim N(1,9)$, and that we have $N=1000$ i.i.d observations

```{julia}
using Random, Distributions
Random.seed!(652); # For reproducibility
N = 1000;
μ_u = 1;
σ_u = 3;
u_is = rand(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), N);
```


## Revealed preference example: data

Next, let's use this distribution to generate the observations of behavior for a (relative) price $p = 2$

We will define $y_i = 1$ if individual $i$ purchases option A, and $y_i = 0$ if $i$ purchases B

```{julia}
p = 2;
y_is = (u_is .- p .> 0);
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Can we use the observed behavior $y_i$ to uncover the unobserved term $u_i$?

. . .

Probably not, because $y_i$ as are binary but $u_i \in \mathbb{R}$ 

```{julia}
using Plots, LaTeXStrings
Plots.scatter(u_is, y_is, xlabel=L"$u_i$", ylabel=L"$y_i$", label="")
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

But what about aggregate behavior? Can it at least inform about the mean of the distribution?

```{julia}
println("We know that $(mean(y_is)*100)% of consumers have u > p")
```

How can we compare that to the population distribution $N(1, 9)$?

. . .

By using the CDF!

```{julia}
1 - cdf(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), p)
```

So the data allowed us to get an estimate of how many individuals have $u_i > 2$

What do we need to be able to say more about this distribution?


## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

If we want to say something about the CDF of $u$ at more points, we need to observe behavior at more prices!

Instead of having a single price, suppose we could confront each consumer with a range of prices and observe their purchasing behavior

We will organize that information in data matrix Z

```{julia}
p_grid = collect(-10:10)
# Rows are individuals i, columns are prices
Z = [(u - p > 0) for u in u_is, p in p_grid]
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Now, for each price level $p_j$, we can calculate the proportion of consumers that chose to purchase A ($y_i(p_j) = 1$)

$$
s(p_j) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} y_i(p_j)
$$


```{julia}
s_p = zeros(length(p_grid))
for j in 1:length(p_grid)
  s_p[j] = mean(Z[:,j]) # Calculate mean of column j
end
```

## Revealed preference example: uncovering preferences

Let's plot $s(p_j)$


```{julia}
plot(s_p, p_grid, xlabel=L"$s$", ylabel=L"$p$", label="Observed")
plot!(1 .- cdf.(Normal(μ_u, σ_u), p_grid), p_grid, linestyle=:dash, label="True distribution")
```

Look at the labels... What kind of curve is this?

. . .

Yep, we just estimated a demand function! (Note that $Q = s \times N$)
